# Tennis Ball Detection Project

Work in this repository has been done for the project in the Deep Neural Networks course at Warsaw University of Technology.
Our goal was to implement a TrackNet network, specialized in tracking high-speed moving objects in video data.
Thus we followed the [TrackNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03698) and implemented the network according to it.

# Training the model

For training the model open the TrackNet.ipynb notebook and run all the cells one by one. You will see some images from the dataset and then
when the training starts, updated loss and metric will be seen in both Google Colab and Google Dashboard.
